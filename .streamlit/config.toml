[secrets]

# List of locations where secrets are searched. An entry can be a path to a
# TOML file or directory path where Kubernetes style secrets are saved.
# Order is important, import is first to last, so secrets in later files
# will take precedence over earlier ones.
# Default: [ <path to local environment's secrets.toml file>, <path to project's secrets.toml file>,]
